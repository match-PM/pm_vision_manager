function_name: "ReduceSaturation"
description: Converts the input BGR image to HSV color space, reduces the saturation of pixels whose hue falls within the specified range [HueMin, HueMax] by dividing their saturation channel by f_reduce_s, then converts the result back to BGR. Useful for toning down dominant colors.
    for the hues given in the 'HueRange'. Then the methods returns an BGR-image. 
    Should help in Images with a dominating Color"
