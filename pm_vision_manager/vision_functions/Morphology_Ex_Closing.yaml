function_name: "Morphology_Ex_Closing"
description: >-  
  Performs a morphological closing operation (dilation followed by erosion) with the specified kernel size to fill small holes and gaps. Works only on binary images.
  **Crucially, any black hole or gap smaller than this kernel size will be filled or closed.**

  **GUIDANCE:**
  1. Use only typical kernelsize: small, odd integers like 3, 5, or 7.
  2. **WARNING:** If the kernelsize is too large, it can incorrectly merge distinct, nearby objects into one, leading to inaccurate contour detection.
