function_name: "Morphology_Ex_Closing"
description: >-  
  Performs a morphological closing operation (dilation followed by erosion) with the specified kernel size to fill small holes and gaps. Works only on binary images.
  **Crucially, any black hole or gap smaller than this kernel size will be filled or closed.**

  **GUIDANCE:**
  1. To fill holes within an object, set the kernelsize slightly larger than the largest hole you want to fill.
  2. To connect separate parts of an object, set the kernelsize larger than the gap between them.
  3. **WARNING:** If the kernelsize is too large, it can incorrectly merge distinct, nearby objects into one, leading to inaccurate contour detection.

  **Typical kernelsize for closing small gaps or holes are small, odd integers like 3, 5, or 7.**
