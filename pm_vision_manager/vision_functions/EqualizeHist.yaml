function_name: "EqualizeHist"
description: >
  Improves global image contrast by equalizing the histogram of a
  single-channel (grayscale) image.

  Histogram equalization redistributes pixel intensities so that the
  full available intensity range is used more effectively. This
  enhances contrast in images with poor or uneven lighting conditions.

  The operation is applied to the currently processed grayscale image
  or channel. The output image has the same dimensions and data type
  as the input.
