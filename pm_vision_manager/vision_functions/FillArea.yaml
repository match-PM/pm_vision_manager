function_name: "FillArea"
description: "Fills all detected contours in a grayscale image, optionally visualizing them, while handling gaps along image borders. This function ensures that disconnected white pixel regions touching the edges are connected, contours are detected and filled in white, and a clean black border is added to the image. Useful for cleaning up binary images and preparing them for further analysis."
