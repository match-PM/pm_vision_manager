function_name: "CircleDetection"
description: >-
  A high-precision circle detector that identifies circles in a **binary image**.
  It operates by finding object contours and then applying a least-squares
  fitting algorithm to the contour points. This function is ideal for
  accurately measuring the center and radius of circular objects in the image.
  **Important**: Set the `minRadius` to 10.0 and `maxRadius` to 10000.0 at first to ensure detection of all circles. Then adjust the range to only detect the desired circles.

  **WARNING:** This method is sensitive and will likely fail if the circles are
  truncated by the image border. The fitting algorithm will be corrupted by the
  non-circular points from the image edge. To handle such cases, a
  `morphological_opening` or `morphological_closing` function **must** be applied to the binary image
  *before* calling this function to detach the shape from the edges.
