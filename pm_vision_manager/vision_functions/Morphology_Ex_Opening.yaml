function_name: "Morphology_Ex_Opening"
description: >-
  Performs a morphological opening operation (erosion followed by dilation). Works only on binary images.
  **Crucially, any white object or connection thinner than this kernel size will be removed.**

  **GUIDANCE:**
  1. Use only typical kernelsize: small, odd integers like 3, 5, or 7.
  2. **WARNING:** If the kernelsize is too large, features will be erased from the image entirely.
