function_name: "Morphology_Ex_Opening"
description: >-
  Performs a morphological opening operation (erosion followed by dilation). Works only on binary images.
  **Crucially, any white object or connection thinner than this kernel size will be removed.**

  **GUIDANCE:**
  1. To remove noise, set the kernelsize slightly larger than the largest noise particle you want to eliminate.
  2. To separate objects or detach them from the border, set the kernelsize larger than the connecting bridge of pixels.
  3. **WARNING:** If the kernelsize is larger than the objects you want to detect, they will be erased from the image entirely.

  **Typical kernelsize for noise removal are small, odd integers like 3, 5, or 7.**
